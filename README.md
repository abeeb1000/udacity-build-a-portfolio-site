The fourth project in [Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program called "Build a Portfolio Site".

## Description
We were given a design mockup and told to replicate the design using HTML and CSS. The site should be responsive and display images, descriptions and links to each of the projects completed throughout the course of the Nanodegree program.

Apart from the above we were given quite an extensive project rubric including everything from design, responsiveness, seperation of concerns to code quality.
