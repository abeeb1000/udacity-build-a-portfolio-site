# udacity-build-a-portfolio-site
The fourth project in [Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program called "Build a Portfolio Site".

## Description
We were given a design mockup and told to replicate the design using HTML and CSS. The site should be responsive and display images, descriptions and links to each of the projects completed throughout the course of the Nanodegree program.

Apart from the above we were given quite an extensive project rubric including everything from design, responsiveness, seperation of concerns to code quality.

## Prerequisites
This block of lessons is the longest in the whole of the course clocking in at 33.5 hours. It is made up of five blocks:

* Sizing Elements
* Intro to HTML and CSS
* Responsive Web Design Fundamentals
* Responsive Images
* Project

### Sizing Elements
The first block covered [the CSS box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model) and [semantic elements in HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5). After this we were given a related problem set.
