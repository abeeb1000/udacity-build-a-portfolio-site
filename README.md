# udacity-build-a-portfolio-site
The fourth project in [Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program called "Build a Portfolio Site".

## Description
We were given a design mockup and told to replicate the design using HTML and CSS. The site should be responsive and display images, descriptions and links to each of the projects completed throughout the course of the Nanodegree program.

Apart from the above we were given quite an extensive project rubric including everything from design, responsiveness, seperation of concerns to code quality.

## Prerequisites
This block of lessons is the longest in the whole of the course clocking in at 33.5 hours. It is made up of five blocks:

* Sizing Elements
* Intro to HTML and CSS
* Responsive Web Design Fundamentals
* Responsive Images
* Project

Below are a short summary of each block; this is in no way a comprehensive or detailed explanation of the content covered.

### Sizing Elements
The first block covered [the CSS box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model) and [semantic elements in HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5). After this we were given a related problem set.

### Intro to HTML and CSS
The second block started with repetition of HTML, CSS, and Boxes. It then went on to handle responsive layout and CSS Frameworks. To start of we created out own framework for responsive layouts.

We then looked at other frameworks, including [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). During this block we were given quizes to make us more familiar with what Bootstrap has to offer. We also looked at how to customize Bootstrap to include the features you need and why minified versions are prefered.
